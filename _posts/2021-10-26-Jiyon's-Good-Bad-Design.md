## An Example of Good Design: Netflix

Netflix's interface is easy to use for a wide variety of users. The design is powerful, yet elegant and simple; TV shows and movies are divided by category, but one can also individually use the search bar in Netflix to find specific titles. The software also tailors suggestions to the user's taste, making the process of finding new shows/movies very convenient for many users. Although the application has only one main affordance––streaming TV entertainment––it accomplishes its purpose to great effect by creating a platform that is easy on the eye, organized, and simple to use.

## An Example of Bad Design: The Toyota Prius

Or, more specifically, the Prius's gear shift. My family used to own a Toyota Prius, and it was a really great car, but the gear shift's design is incredibly confusing. The letters on the shift stand for each mode the car can go into, but they are placed irrationally; to move the car in reverse, for example, you have to push the handle in the forward direction (the R is at the top of the handle). This is very counterintuitive; why push forward to move backwards? Similarly, to move forward ("drive" mode), the handle has to be moved backwards. And finally, the "B" on the gear shift is infamous for being considered an enigma among Prius drivers. What does it stand for? Very few people know, and thus many users don't use the mode.
