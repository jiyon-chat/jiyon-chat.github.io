## Introduction

My experience in App Development this year has been revelatory about the detailed, methodical nature of problem-solving. Designers cannot go about pitching ideas and creating prototypes without a clear idea of the problem they are attempting to solve. So much of the year was focused on the investigatory and brainstorming phase of design––first the focus was on organizing our observations (through affinity diagrams, etc.) and then creating prototypes. From this process, I have a few takeaways about significant aspects of being a UX designer.

## Body:

In my experience, the process of design should involve five underlying considerations:

## Sense of Purpose

All design undertakings, fundamentally, should solve a problem. Designers should be motivated by a true desire to solve this problem, rather than other interests (like money, grades, etc.). I find that a true interest in the problem that a design addresses will usually result in a more useful, workable output for users. In my experience this year with Korffers Connect, the purpose of our theoretical app underwent a fairly significant evolution from start to finish. Initially we were interested in cross-grade unity, and though this theme remained throughout the stages of development, our purpose eventually became more focused. We observed from our fly on the wall lab that students across grades at HM are most communicative with each other when discussing classwork and academic life. Only after we made this crucial observation could we move ahead with an app idea for an online forum where students can easily access information about classes from other students and communicate assistance/questions to others.

## Accessibility

This does not only mean accessibility in the traditional context centering disability; designs should be accessible across different levels of experience, cultural backgrounds, and thought processes. An app will only be used by a wide user base if it is somewhat “universal” in its design. Therefore, we ensured that our app prototype was designed based on the shared experience of all Upper Division students (not just sophomores or seniors, for example). To do this, the contextual inquiry was crucial: we could only know about shared experiences by observing different types of HM students in their natural habitats.

## Functional Clarity

An app, obviously, is useless if it cannot be used. Our UX prototype testing process revealed blindspots that we would not have necessarily identified in our own group bubble; for example, we got great advice about a lack of feedback in the app’s instructions and problems with “back buttons.” Our app seemed easy to use for us, because we came up with the idea. But without testing it on different students––potential users––we would not have a realistic idea of how usable the app truly is.

## Aesthetic Pleasure

As distracting as comments about aesthetic pleasure might be, users will only choose to use an app if it is easy on the eye. People take no pleasure in using ugly designs, and we did receive some feedback about fonts and color in our user testing. Aesthetic pleasure is a critical consideration because a useful app may not be used to its full extent because users are turned off by its design. Our prototype went through a few stages of visual development until it attained its final purple shade, with its font.
